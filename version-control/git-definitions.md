# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control allows you to not do some crazy stuff and keep people happy. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is a way of working on a file while maintaining an original copy for safety purposes. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? Commit is timestamping the file. It is important to be specific with the change made.
* What is a merge conflict? This is not being able to integrate the changes made back into the original.
